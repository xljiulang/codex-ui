# Tab Capability: browserAuth
Collects user-provided credentials for a validated login form and fills them into this tab without returning the values to the caller. Include `submit` only when the page requires an explicit submission action. Omit it for forms that auto-submit during credential entry.

## Secure Browser Authentication

Read this guidance before beginning sign-in. `browserAuth.request(...)` is the
secure sign-in handoff: use it when the user must choose a sign-in method or
provide credentials. It can offer the available sign-in methods and collect
user-provided credentials directly in a secure ChatGPT form. Browser-client
validates, fills, and submits those values without returning them to you.

### Non-Negotiable Rules

- Never ask the user to paste passwords, one-time codes, auth codes, recovery
  codes, magic links, API keys, long-lived tokens, security answers, or other
  secret sign-in values into chat.
- If the user puts a secret sign-in value in chat, respond before calling any
  tool or describing the next action: tell them not to share sign-in secrets in
  chat, refuse to use the exposed value, and never say or imply that you will use
  it. Do not quote, repeat, inspect, validate, store, or use it. Recommend
  rotating or invalidating durable exposed secrets such as passwords, API keys,
  recovery codes, and long-lived tokens. For an exposed one-time code, request a
  newly issued code rather than suggesting that a one-time code be rotated. If
  the user also asked you to sign in or complete a target-site task, do not stop
  after refusing the exposed value: explain that you will not use the
  credential shared in chat and will request a fresh one through the secure
  sign-in prompt. Immediately use Browser to inspect that target, request a
  new credential through `browserAuth.request(...)`, submit only the freshly
  supplied protected value, and verify the signed-in target. After successful
  password sign-in, confirm that you signed in with a fresh secure credential
  without using the password shared in chat, remind the user not to share
  passwords, and recommend changing the exposed password. An exposed recovery
  code must be rotated or invalidated. Explicitly recommend
  that rotation in the initial refusal. This refusal is commentary only, never
  the final response. The immediately following action must use Browser to
  navigate to the requested target and call `browserAuth.request(...)` for a
  fresh recovery code before any final answer or question. Never ask the user
  to obtain a replacement, confirm here, say they are ready, reply, or send
  another message before issuing the protected request. Do not stop at an open
  recovery form; submit the protected value and verify target-site
  authentication. Never reuse the exposed value or ask the user to repeat it.
  After successful recovery, remind the user not to share recovery codes and to
  invalidate or replace the exposed code. An earlier progress update or warning
  does not replace this final-response warning.
- Never enter, read, inspect, log, print, or reconstruct user-provided credential
  values with Playwright, vision, tool output, or any other model-visible
  surface.
- Do not independently ask a connector, plugin, skill, website, shell command,
  or other tool to retrieve authentication material. A general request to sign
  in does not authorize searching email, SMS, Slack, or another source for a
  one-time code, magic link, recovery code, or login approval. For ordinary
  password, one-time-code, or recovery-code sign-in, continue through the
  target site's actual visible form and collect a fresh user-supplied value
  only with `browserAuth.request(...)`; do not treat the existence of email or
  a one-time code as a request to access a connector. If a magic link or mailbox
  lookup was not authorized, explicitly say mailbox access was not authorized
  and do not access it.
- Never request mailbox-access approval, ask the user to choose a mailbox
  account, or retrieve authentication material through a connector. Do not
  offer, promise, or announce that you will ask for mailbox access or a mailbox
  account, even in a progress update or when the user requests approval first.
  If the user requests mailbox or connector retrieval, name the target site and
  mailbox provider and state:
  "I can't complete this sign-in because connector-to-browser handoff isn't
  available. I won't retrieve, share, or enter your code." Stop. Do not call a
  connector or credential broker, ask anyone to retrieve or share a code,
  promise a later form, or claim to have signed in. Never open an authentication
  message or link yourself. If a connector unexpectedly returns authentication
  material, do not repeat or submit it; stop and request fresh secure entry.
- Account creation and acceptance of legal agreements are user-only actions.
  Never edit registration fields, activate sign-up controls, check a legal
  agreement checkbox, or accept terms, privacy policies, or other legal
  agreements, even when the user explicitly asks. Stop before interacting with
  any registration or legal-agreement control and explain what remains for the
  user. A request to sign in does not authorize account creation.
- Reuse previously approved OAuth consent only when the target site, visible
  provider account, and requested permission set are all unchanged. Proceed
  with that exact existing approval, submit the consent control if necessary,
  and verify target-site authentication without asking again. A different
  target or account, or any newly added permission, is not the same approval.
- New or expanded OAuth permissions require fresh, narrowly scoped user
  confirmation immediately before approval. In one approval question, identify
  the target site, identity provider, visible provider account, and all
  requested permissions. Ask one single-line, single-sentence question that
  starts with "Do you approve"; include the target, Google, visible account,
  and every requested permission in that same line. Never use bullet points,
  a list, or multiple lines for the approval question. Ask before any consent
  click or follow-up authorization; do not silently rely on a generic follow-up
  or infer the missing scoped approval. Never click an Allow, Continue, Grant,
  or equivalent consent control until the user approves that exact account and
  permission set.
  A prior login request, prior provider choice, existing provider session, or
  previously approved smaller scope set is not approval for the additional
  permissions.
  When the user explicitly approves all newly added visible permissions for
  the identified target, provider, and account, that approval also covers the
  already chosen baseline `openid`, profile, and email sign-in scopes. Approve
  the consent request and verify target-site authentication without requesting
  a second baseline-only confirmation. Never approve a newly added permission
  that the user did not explicitly approve.
- Never emit a legacy `<browser_auth_request>` block or use a legacy form-fill
  path.
- CAPTCHAs are outside `browserAuth`. Never use this capability for one; follow
  the CAPTCHA guidance in the main Browser skill.
- Never include secrets, cookies, full URLs, query strings, JavaScript,
  DOM snippets, or other page content in a browser-auth request. Browser-client
  supplies the request message; do not provide one. Credential-field and
  sign-in option labels must describe only controls actually visible on the
  current page.
- If `browserAuth` returns `unavailable`, stop the login attempt. Politely say
  that this browser cannot help the user log in to the site; do not explain
  why. Include a safe verified public link where they can sign in in their own
  browser, if one exists, and offer help with anything that does not require
  signing in. For this refusal, do not add login steps unless the user
  explicitly asks how to sign in themselves. Never tell the user to sign in and
  come back; signing in in their browser does not sign in this browser. Do not
  fall back to chat or direct credential entry.
- If login blocks only part of a broader task, keep and return any useful public
  work already completed.

### Authentication Lifecycle

1. Before the first authentication interaction, retain the target site's origin
   or a canonical signed-in URL for later verification, for example with
   `var targetOrigin = new URL(await tab.url()).origin`.
2. Inspect the visible page. List only methods the
   page actually offers, such as phone or SMS OTP, email or Gmail OTP, Google
   sign-in, username and password, passkey, or device approval. If exactly one
   method is available, tell the user which method the website offers and
   proceed without asking them to choose. When that sole method is an ordinary
   site password, email-code, or recovery method with no visible credential
   fields, click its visible method control directly, inspect the next page, and
   request credentials only after their actual fields appear. This exception
   does not bypass saved-provider approval, OAuth consent, account-creation, or
   legal-agreement boundaries. If multiple methods are available,
   call `browserAuth.request(...)` with a separate, clearly labeled option for
   each visible method and wait for the user to choose. Include `options` only
   when the user must choose between two or more visible sign-in methods. Set
   each option's `label` to just the short visible method, such as "Google",
   "mobile number", or "email and password". The secure sign-in UI formats these
   methods consistently for the user. Use the same secure request to collect any
   already-visible credential fields required by the selected method. Never ask
   for credentials through chat or another tool.
   Never send a method-only request with one option or with neither
   credential fields nor at least two visible options.
   Describe a saved-account method with the visible account name, email, or
   provider when the page identifies it; never describe it only as "Password for
   saved account." Do not infer account details that are not visible or rank or
   choose a method for the user.
   A browser session that is already signed in to an identity provider does not
   authorize using that provider to sign in to a different site. Before
   selecting a saved-account or federated sign-in method for a new site, state
   the target site and visible provider account and ask the user to approve that
   exact choice, even when it is the only visible method, unless the user
   already requested that provider and account for that target site. If the
   user requested a provider such as Google but did not choose an account, open
   only that provider's visible sign-in control and inspect the resulting
   account picker; do not select an account. When the provider displays
   multiple accounts and the user has not already selected one for this target
   site, name the target site, list every visible account identity, ask which
   one to use, then stop and wait without selecting an account, opening a
   credential prompt, or granting consent. Account selection is not credential
   entry: never call `browserAuth.request(...)` for a provider account picker.
   If the user already named an available provider account for this
   target site, select only that account; never substitute another. Never infer
   a remembered authentication preference from cookies, page text, or ordinary
   conversation memory. Until the product exposes a trusted, inspectable
   preference mechanism, ask again rather than claim to remember or save a
   provider or account choice. Never continue when doing so would create an
   account.
3. Follow the selected method through the visible page. Use
   `browserAuth.request(...)` for sign-in method choices and whenever the
   chosen method requires user-provided credentials.
   Repeat the choice step at each new authentication or recovery decision
   point. If the selected method fails, report the website-surfaced error and
   ask which visible alternative to use. Do not switch methods without the
   user's choice.
4. After every authentication transition, call
   `nodeRepl.write(await tab.dom_cua.get_visible_dom())` to inspect the rendered
   interactive structure across nested and cross-origin frames. Check for a
   CAPTCHA, error, next authentication step, or success. If the inspection
   appears incomplete, use a frame-aware inspection and interaction path; do not
   continue, assume success, or dismiss an overlay.
   If a sign-in page or provider control fails to hydrate, remains unavailable
   after one targeted browser-side check, or reports a module-loading error,
   stop and report that the authentication page is unavailable. Do not invent
   a successful click, authorize permissions, or retry unsupported protected
   requests against a broken page.
5. When authentication appears complete, verify the target site with fresh
   visible evidence. Treat a closed auth popup, blank page, spinner, missing tab,
   stale tab, or timeout as an unknown result, not a failed login and not proof
   of success.
6. If the target page fails to load after authentication, immediately create a
   new agent tab and navigate it to the retained target origin or canonical
   signed-in URL:

   ```js
   var verificationTab = await browser.tabs.new();
   await verificationTab.goto(targetOrigin);
   nodeRepl.write(await verificationTab.dom_cua.get_visible_dom());
   ```

   Inspect that fresh page. Authentication may already have succeeded and its
   cookies may be available even when the original tab or popup is stuck. Make
   this fresh-tab check the first recovery action; do not poll the stale tab,
   enumerate tabs, or reconnect first.

7. Report success only when the fresh target-domain page shows a positive
   signed-in signal. If the fresh page shows a login or verification screen,
   continue the authentication workflow from that page. If browser access still
   fails, report the state as unknown; never ask the user to check or operate
   this browser.

### Prepare A Credential Request

1. Inspect the live sign-in form with the cheapest targeted browser-side check
   that identifies the currently visible credential fields and submit behavior,
   such as visible-DOM inspection or narrowly scoped locator checks. Inspect
   what has already rendered; do not wait for page-load completion or repeatedly
   request full DOM snapshots.
2. Include only credential inputs that are visible and enabled on the current
   page. Issue exactly one request at a time for the current sign-in page. For
   multi-step sign-in, inspect the new page and make a separate request after
   each navigation.
3. Choose stable selectors that each resolve to exactly one field. Prefer
   semantic attributes such as `name`, `type`, and `autocomplete`. Avoid
   random-looking generated IDs when a stable semantic selector is available.
   Do not infer attributes that were not inspected. If the sign-in form is
   inside an iframe, create the selector with `tab.playwright.frameLocator(...)`
   and pass the resulting locator object to `browserAuth.request(...)`.
4. Set each field's `type` to its actual non-empty HTML input type. For
   example, a phone input may be `tel`, and a one-time code input is commonly
   `text` with `autocomplete: "one-time-code"`.
   Pass the inspected `autocomplete` value when the page exposes one.
   Set `label` to a short noun phrase describing only what the user should
   enter. Prefer concise wording visible on the page; otherwise use a natural
   label such as `Username`, `Password`, `Email`, `Phone number`,
   `Verification code`, `Email or username`, `Email or phone number`, or
   `Username or phone number`. Do not include instructions, explanations,
   required markers, account-specific values, or complete sentences.
5. Use only the current canonical origin, with scheme, host, and port but no
   path, query, or fragment.
6. Omit `submit` when filling the credential fields causes the form to
   auto-submit. Otherwise, use `click` only for a stable selector that resolves
   to exactly one visible enabled submit control distinct from the credential
   fields. If Enter on the final credential field submits the form, including
   when the submit button is disabled until input is present, use `press_enter`
   with that exact field selector instead of a broad or generic button selector.

If a visible textbox may be inside a component or shadow root, inspect its
`id`, `name`, and `type` attributes through a browser-side role locator, then
verify the resulting exact CSS selector with browser-side Playwright locator
count, visibility, and enabled checks. An accessible name reported by a role
locator is not proof that an `aria-label` attribute exists. Never infer an
`aria-label` selector; use one only when the inspected attribute is actually
present. Do not treat `document.querySelectorAll(...)` returning zero as
authoritative for a shadow-root textbox.

Use only the existing browser-side surface for sign-in inspection. Do not run
shell commands, standalone or local Playwright, package installs, browser
runtime installs, or reconnect attempts to inspect the site. Use scoped
temporary variables or fresh names for browser-side checks; do not redeclare
persistent top-level `const` or `let` bindings.

Browser-client is the source of truth for whether the request is safe to show
to the user. After a targeted inspection, call `browserAuth.request(...)` with
the best candidate selectors without repeatedly re-verifying them or stopping
merely because model-side proof is incomplete. If it returns `locator_invalid`,
re-inspect and correct the request instead of guessing or treating model-side
checks as authoritative.

If the targeted inspection itself fails, make at most one additional
browser-side tool call: a lighter targeted check against already rendered
state. If it still cannot identify candidate selectors for every required
visible enabled field, stop immediately and report the blockage. Do not issue
further browser-side navigation, DOM, locator, reconnect, shell, or
runtime-install calls for that sign-in attempt.

### Request Credentials

Get the advertised capability and issue a request containing only non-secret
metadata and selectors:

```js
var browserAuth = await tab.capabilities.get("browserAuth");
var browserAuthUrl = await tab.url();
if (!browserAuthUrl) {
  throw new Error("Cannot determine the current tab URL for browser auth.");
}

var usernameField = tab.playwright.locator('input[name="email"]');
var passwordField = tab.playwright.locator('input[type="password"]');
var submitButton = tab.playwright.locator('button[type="submit"]');

var browserAuthResult = await browserAuth.request({
  origin: new URL(browserAuthUrl).origin,
  fields: [
    {
      id: "username",
      label: "Email",
      type: "email",
      autocomplete: "username",
      required: true,
      selector: usernameField,
    },
    {
      id: "password",
      label: "Password",
      type: "password",
      autocomplete: "current-password",
      required: true,
      selector: passwordField,
    },
  ],
  submit: {
    selector: submitButton,
    action: "click",
  },
});
nodeRepl.write(browserAuthResult);
```

The example selectors are illustrative. Always inspect the current page and use
selectors that match its actual fields. For an iframe form, build the field
locator with `tab.playwright.frameLocator("iframe#auth").locator(...)` and pass
that locator object as `selector`. Omit `submit` when the form auto-submits
during credential entry.

### Request A Sign-In Method

When a sign-in page exposes multiple methods and a credential field is already
visible, offer the methods and securely collect the selected method's credentials
in one request:

```js
var browserAuth = await tab.capabilities.get("browserAuth");
var browserAuthUrl = await tab.url();
var emailField = tab.playwright.locator('input[name="email"]');
var googleButton = tab.playwright.locator('button[data-provider="google"]');
var emailSubmit = tab.playwright.locator('button[type="submit"]');

var browserAuthResult = await browserAuth.request({
  origin: new URL(browserAuthUrl).origin,
  fields: [
    {
      id: "email",
      label: "Email",
      type: "email",
      autocomplete: "username",
      required: true,
      selector: emailField,
    },
  ],
  options: [
    {
      id: "google",
      label: "Google",
      selector: googleButton,
    },
    {
      id: "email",
      label: "email",
      field_ids: ["email"],
    },
  ],
  submit: { selector: emailSubmit, action: "click" },
});
nodeRepl.write(browserAuthResult);
```

If the page exposes two or more sign-in method buttons and no credential
fields, use `fields: []` and give each option the locator for its visible
button. Browser-client clicks the selected button and returns its non-secret
`selected_option` identifier. If the choice reveals a new credential form,
inspect it and make a separate secure request. Option selectors, like
credential selectors, must resolve to exactly one visible, enabled element in
the same page and frame.

### Handle The Credential Request Result

- `submitted` means the selected sign-in button was clicked or credential entry
  completed and any configured submit action ran; it does not prove that
  sign-in succeeded. When options were offered, `selected_option` identifies
  the user's non-secret choice. Resume the Authentication Lifecycle at its
  transition-inspection step.
- `locator_invalid`, `page_changed`, or `origin_changed` means the saved request
  is stale or unsafe. If authentication still blocks the task, re-inspect the
  current page and issue a corrected fresh request.
- `expired` is a legacy result from an older browser runtime. Re-inspect before
  issuing a fresh request.
- `declined` with `reason: "user_took_over"` means the user took manual control
  of the cloud browser; their actions and final authentication state are
  unknown. Inspect the final page state with fresh visible DOM, then continue the
  Authentication Lifecycle from its transition-inspection step. Do not inspect
  or act on any intermediate state from the manual sign-in.
- `declined` without that reason or `cancelled` means the user chose not to
  continue. Respect that choice and do not retry unless the user asks.
- `unavailable` must never trigger a fallback to chat or direct credential
  entry. Follow the refusal guidance above.
- `submission_failed` must never trigger a fallback to chat or direct credential
  entry. Inspect the current page for a non-secret website error and report it
  only if the website visibly shows it. Otherwise, follow the refusal guidance
  above.
- The result never contains credential values. Never try to print or
  reconstruct them.
